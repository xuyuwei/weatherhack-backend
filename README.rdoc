=== Fit Trip

This is the back end for the Fit Trip app that was created at MHacks V. The back end is done in Ruby and primarily consists
of APIs that the front end can call to. It is written in Ruby using the Ruby on Rails framework and makes calls to Google Places,
Wolfram Alpha and Weather Underground APIs.
